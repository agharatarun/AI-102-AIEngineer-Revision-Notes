#Azure AI Services#
-----
Think of AI as software that exhibits one or more human-like capabilities.
1. **Visual perception** - The ability to use computer vision capabilities to accept, interpret, and process input from images, video streams, and live cameras.
2. **Text analysis and conversation** - The ability to use natural language processing (NLP) to not only "read", but also generate realistic responses and extract semantic meaning from text.
3. **Speech** - The ability to recognize speech as input and synthesize spoken output. The combination of speech capabilities together with the ability to apply NLP analysis of text enables a form of human-compute interaction that's become known as conversational AI.
4. **Decision making** - The ability to use past experience and learned correlations to assess situations and take appropriate actions. For example, recognizing anomalies in sensor readings and taking automated action to prevent failure or system damage.

**AI-related terms**
1. **Data science**: Data science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the processing and analysis of data; applying statistical techniques to uncover and visualize relationships and patterns in the data, and defining experimental models that help explore those patterns. Data scientist might gather samples of data about the population of an endangered species in a geographical area, and combine it with data about levels of industrialization and economic demographics in the same area.
2. **Machine learning**: Data scientists often work with machine learning models. Machine learning deals with the training and validation of predictive models. Typically, a data scientist prepares the data and then uses it to train a model based on an algorithm that exploits the relationships between the features in the data to predict values for unknown labels. **Use factors**: such as the number of nesting sites observed, the area of land designated as protected, the human population in the local area, the daily volume of traffic on local roads, and so on. **evaluate plan**: for housing, infrastructure, and industrial development in the local area and assess their likely impact on the local wildlife
3. **Artificial intelligence**: Artificial intelligence (AI) describes software that emulates one or more characteristics of human intelligence. Machine learning is a prominent approach used to create AI software. Knowledge of data science can support an understanding of artificial intelligence. **a predictive model** could be trained to analyze image data taken by motion-activated cameras in remote locations, and predict whether a photograph contains a sighting of the animal

After the model has been trained, you can submit new data that includes known feature values and have the model predict the most likely label. Using the model to make predictions is referred to as **inferencing**.
Software developers should make use of **confidence score** values to evaluate predictions and apply appropriate thresholds to optimize application reliability and mitigate the risk of predictions that may be made based on marginal probabilities.
software engineers building AI-enabled solutions should apply due consideration to **mitigate risks and ensure fairness, reliability, and adequate protection from harm or discrimination.**
Responsible AI: Fairness, Reliability and safety, Privacy and Security, Inclusiveness, Transparency, Accountability.

**Automated machine learning**: This feature enables **non-experts to quickly create an effective machine learning model** from data.
**Azure Machine Learning designer**:	A graphical interface enabling **no-code development** of machine learning solutions.
**Data and compute management**: **Cloud-based data storage and compute resources** that professional data scientists can use to run data experiment code at scale.
**Pipelines**:	Data scientists, software engineers, and IT operations professionals can define pipelines to **orchestrate model training, deployment, and management tasks**.

Software engineers may interact with Azure Machine Learning in the following ways:
1. Using Automated Machine Learning or Azure Machine Learning designer to train machine learning models and deploy them as services that can be integrated into AI-enabled applications.
2. Collaborating with data scientists to deploy models based on common frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow as web services, and consume them in applications.
3. **Using Azure Machine Learning SDKs or command-line interface (CLI) scripts** to orchestrate DevOps processes that manage versioning, deployment, and testing of machine learning models as part of an overall application **delivery solution**.
